2014-02-10 Matt:
	* Updated plotting scripts
	* Removed bunch number from Options.h and store it in meta data

2014-12-16 Matt:
	* Investigating the width of the beam impact. Turned off errors for E-field. Remember
		to turn them back on the future!!!

2014-11-18 Matt:
	* Adding the x, y, z information for A and E. This means we can look at the horizontal and
		vertical polarizations.  If we want more complicated polarizations more work
		will be needed.

2014-11-07 Matt:
	* Adding some plotting scripts
	* Committing small updates to get plotting results
	* Tagging first version

2014-11-06 Matt:
	* E-field calculated now with errors
	* Added vector<TH1F*> to linkdef, now can read them back in interactive root mode
	* Added Sumw2 setting for histograms
	* Adding Tools package.  Will expand on this later after more tests.
	* Verified FTFD is working, FTTD has not been checked yet.
	* Verified FTTD is working. Had to remove "scale" from old code. I think I was just making
		some error before that somehow cancelled out.
	* Adding options to get correct scaling down.


2014-11-05 Matt:
	* Was being stupid with the makefile. Now everything is working ok and I can get
		shared libraries as well.
	* Committing skeleton of TreeMaker
	* Committing skeleton of the file reader
	* Forgot src directory all together
	* Working version committed. Need to add something to be able to readback vector<TH1F*>
		in interactive mode.

2014-11-04 Matt:
	* Adding structure and initial skeleton of code.  Subject to change.
	* Adding Skeleton makefile and LinkDef
